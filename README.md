# Illuminating the Diversity-Fitness Trade-Off in Black-Box Optimization
This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the paper Illuminating the Diversity-Fitness Trade-Off in Black-Box Optimization.

It proposes python code to run the experiments illustrated in the paper. In particular, the greedy approach starting from a random sample, a sobol sequence, and evaluations from selected algorithms
via [IOHprofiler](https://iohprofiler.github.io/), and appropriate code to store all the data obtained.
The selected algorithms are and the code packages used for the random sample and the sobol sequence are: 
- CMA-ES from the [pycma](https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma) package.
- HillVallEA algorithm from [Benchmarking HillVallEA for the GECCO 2019
Competition on Multimodal Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10988.pdf).
- RS-CMSAII) introduced in [Static and Dynamic Multimodal Optimization by Improved Covariance Matrix Self-Adaptation Evolution Strategy With Repelling Subpopulations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555836).
- WGraD proposed in [Niche Method Complementing the Nearest-better Clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9002742).
- Random sample, taken from the Python module numpy using the method [random.uniform](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.uniform.html).
- Sobol sequence taken from the Python package sobol_seq using the method [i4_sobol_generate](https://pypi.org/project/sobol/).


This code runs the greedy approach presented in the paper starting from these sample sets on the 24 functions of the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) suite from the [COCO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08785.pdf) benchmarking environment suite using their definition from [IOHprofiler](https://iohprofiler.github.io/). The code to run the selected algorithms and to have the initial sets are taken from [CMA-ES](https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma), [HillVallEA](https://github.com/SCMaree/HillVallEA), [RS-CMSA](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357877953_Python_code_RS-CMSA-ESII), [WGraD](https://github.com/yuhaoli-95/WGraD), [random search](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.uniform.html) and [sobol_seq](https://pypi.org/project/sobol/). Moreover, it contains also the Python code to solve the MILP problem explained in the paper through Gurobi. We provide all the Python files to run the paper experiments and to store results in data files.

# Libraries and dependencies

The implementation of all tasks and algorithms to perform experiments are in Python 3.7.4 and all the libraries used are listed in `requirements.txt`.
To use Gurobi a license is required, check the website [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com).


# Structure
- `main_random.py` contains the code to run the greedy approach starting from a random sample.
- `main_sobol.py` contains the code to run the greedy approach starting from a random sample.
- `main_on_other_alg.py` contains the code to run the greedy approach starting from a sample of evaluations loaded from a pre-existed txt file.
- `main_Gurobi.py` contains the code to define and solve the MILP problem with Gurobi. 
- `Run_random_sobol.sh` is a Slurm job script for the Linux cluster environment. There is a loop within the script to run main_random.py or main_sobol.py multiple times with different parameters.
- `Run_greedy.sh` is a Slurm job script for the Linux cluster environment. There is a loop within the script to run main_on_other_alg.py multiple times with different parameters.
- `Run_Gurobi.sh` is a Slurm job script for the Linux cluster environment. It loads the Gurobi license and runs main_Gurobi.py.
- `requirements.txt` contains the list of all the projectâ€™s dependencies with the specific version of each dependency.
